# ORCHESTRATE

We are team Caffeine Overflow from Northcoders November 2021 cohort. For our project we came up with the idea for a web application that would allow classical musicians both professional and freelance to book venues and rehearsal spaces as well as to socialise and interact with other musicians within the application. 

Following the creation of our API, we have created this multi-functional application.

## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js installed on your environement.

[Node](http://nodejs.org/) is really easy to install & now include [NPM](https://npmjs.org/).

## Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/mavie1322/fe-bmal.git
    $ cd PROJECT
    $ npm install
    $ npm start

Open your browser and visit <http://localhost:3000>

## Simple build for production

    $ npm run build

## Build with:

- React
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- UIKit

## Difficulties:

Initially, we wanted to use Svelte. However there were several issues with documentation and trying to implement it with the backend that we had put  together. We ultimately decided to drop this tech in favour of React. 

## Improvements:

To be complete:
- messaging
- join group 
- book venue
- add/remove friend
- remove venue
- remove group
